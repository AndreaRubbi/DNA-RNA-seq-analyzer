# DNA-RNA seq analyzer by: Andrea Rubbi
Python file with many useful functions that could be exploited to analyze DNA or RNA sequences 

## About:

This is the result of the project of the basic python programming 
course of my Genomics degree and thus my really first python 'project'.

This program contains several useful tools for analyzing RNA/DNA sequences.

## How to:

### Use it:

I would recommend to read it and take it as a starting point rather than directly 
use it as it is really badly written and not 'Class implemented'.

### Test it:

Try to run the Test.py program to see the output of all of the functions of the program.

## NB: give a look at the Knuth Morris Prath algorithm implementation!
